Smart Parking System using HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor After extensive research and testing, I developed a smart parking system that detects available parking spaces using the HC-SR04 sensor. The system accurately identifies occupied and free slots, reducing traffic congestion and saving time, making parking more efficient and eco-friendly.
